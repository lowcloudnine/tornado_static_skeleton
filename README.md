# tornado_static_template
A template for a static index served by Tornado.  Includes HTML5 boilerplate and Bootstrap.

The supervisord branch is for adding supervisor capabilities to the tornado static
skeleton.  When the branch is complete, documentation for running the tornado
server via supervisord will be below.  The branch should be kept as a permanent
part of the project and the devel branch should be merged in after other 
pieces are added, i.e. logging.  This allows for a supervisor controlled 
server example and a non-supervior controlled example.
